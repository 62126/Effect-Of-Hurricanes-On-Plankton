# EffectOfHurricanesOnPlankton
Collected spatial data on plankton in Brighton to then wrangle and apply appropriate regression models to understand the effects of hurricanes on Phytoplankton. This piece of collaborative work was achieved through a series of sprint cycles where we held multiple meetings to discuss and update all members of our progress.
